# PencilTool

This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/) by Georg Seifert.
It adds a custom Pencil Tool to Glyphs, allowing you to draw freely with a pencil-like interface in Edit View. After installation, it will add the tool to the toolbar with the icon *PencilTool.pdf*.

### Installation

1. Download the complete ZIP file and unpack it, or clone the repository.
2. Double click the `.glyphsTool` file. Confirm the dialog that appears in Glyphs.
3. Restart Glyphs.

### Usage Instructions

1. Open a glyph in Edit View.
2. Select the Pencil Tool from the toolbar.
3. Click and drag in the editor to draw paths freely.

The tool works interactively, so you can create custom shapes directly on the glyph canvas.

### Pencil Tool Palette

The Pencil Tool comes with a palette that lets you fine-tune your strokes:

- **Thickness**: Adjust the width of the lines you draw.  
- **Smoothing**: Control how smooth or sharp the curves are. Higher values produce smoother, flowing paths; lower values follow your mouse movements more closely.

Using this palette, you can create both precise and expressive shapes directly on the glyph canvas.

### Requirements

The plugin requires Glyphs 3.2 or higher. It may not work in earlier versions.
